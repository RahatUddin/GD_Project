        <p>Hi there,</p>
        <p>My name is Rahat, I've spent this quarantine trying to learn something new. I've always wanted to learn game development and with all this free time during lockdown I thought why not start now...</p>
        <p><a href="https://learn.unity.com/project/tanks-tutorial">https://learn.unity.com/project/tanks-tutorial</a> - I followed this course which I would recommend to anyone else who is also interested. Once I was finished I wanted to utilise the skills I learnt and add my own touch to the game.</p>
        <p>I decided to create a Survival Mode into the game, implementing AI enemies which increase as the rounds go on. I've implemented my progress to my GitHub so anyone can have a go.
        <p>At this moment in time the game is only supported on PC.</p>
        <p>==Controls==</p>
        <p>W, A, S, D - Move Player</p>
        <p>[SpaceBar] - Shoot</p>
        <p>Hold [SpaceBar] - Charge up shot</p>
        <p>Enjoy :D</p>
