Hi there,

My name is Rahat, I've spent this quarantine trying to learn something new.
I've always wanted to learn game development and with all this free time during lockdown I thought why not start now...

https://learn.unity.com/project/tanks-tutorial - I followed this course which I would recommend to anyone else who is also interested. Once I was finished I wanted to utilise the skills I learnt and add my own touch to the game.

I decided to create a Survival Mode into the game, implementing AI enemies which increase as the rounds go on. I've implemented my progress to my GitHub so anyone can have a go. 

At this moment in time the game is only supported on PC.

==Controls==

W, A, S, D - Move Player

[SpaceBar] - Shoot

Hold [SpaceBar] - Charge up shot

Here's the link to the game: https://rahatuddin.github.io/GD_Project/

Enjoy :D
